      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>A small dog is curled up by a roaring fire.</p>
      <p>Grandma was in her rocking chair drinking hot cocoa.</p>
      <p>Suddenly a loud bang on the window distracts her from the socks she's knitting.</p>
      <p>She sends Grandpa outside to see what happened.</p>
      <p>Upon inspection, Grandpa notices a branch hitting the window ominously. Relieved, he laughs..</p>
      <p>Then suddenly, he turns and is faced with Big Foot staring him down! Eeeek!</p>
